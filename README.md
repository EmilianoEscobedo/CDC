React website for an argentinian bulding company based in Valeria del Mar, Buenos Aires.<br><br>
This is my third project using react.js in the front-end, it is a simple project, but it allowed me to strengthen knowledge and skills and improve the management of libraries such as react-router-dom
<br><br>

## :question: What is and why
The main objective was build a fully responsive landing page, where potential customers can see about the company, its how-to-do filosofy, its projects and can communicate to work with it through a meeting schedule system.

## :gear: How it Works
The front-end was built using React.js and UI libraries like Bootstrap 5 and Font Awesome, it also incorporates routes with react-router-dom and its react-router-dom-haslinks variant.
The back-end works on the basis of the firebase services of firestore db, storage for the assets and hosting + domain, it is connected to the front-end with the react-firebase-hooks hooks<br><br>
